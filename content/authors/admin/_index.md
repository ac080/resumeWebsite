I am currently a Bachelor of Science in Information System student with a major in Smart-City Management and Technology, and a second major in Financial Technology.

I have gained valuable experience in various fields such as healthcare, education, and community outreach. The exposure I have has helped me develop strong interpersonal and communication skills, allowing me to effectively collaborate with the people around me. My involvement in co-curricular activities and volunteer work, such as SMU Ellipsis and SSU Project Naksu 2.0, has honed my leadership and teamwork abilities as I managed teams and organized welfare drives for hundreds of students. Additionally, having a role as a Public Relations Director helped me better communicate with stakeholders. I am eager to contribute to the growth and success of a dynamic organisation where I can make a meaningful impact.
